DESCRIPTION : The deliverables for this project include a redesigned ride selection interface for a ride-hailing application, focusing on enhanced clarity, usability, and a structured fare breakdown. The redesigned interface consists of two key screens: the main ride selection screen and the fare breakdown screen. The first screen presents a clean and intuitive layout, displaying available ride options such as Uber Auto, Uber Go, Moto, and Moto Saver, along with their estimated fares, promotional discounts, and expected arrival times. The layout emphasizes readability by incorporating distinct sections for ride categories, payment options (cash and net banking), and promotional offers. Additionally, it includes a prominent call-to-action button labeled "Choose Uber Auto," ensuring users can confirm their ride selection with ease. The second screen provides a detailed fare breakdown for Uber Auto, listing individual components such as base fare, distance fare, time fare, surge pricing, applicable discounts, taxes, and final fare. The fare details are aligned for better readability, with the final fare highlighted in green to indicate clarity and transparency in pricing. A key aspect of the redesign was ensuring proper alignment and spacing of text elements, maintaining a structured and professional look. The icons for different ride options were carefully placed within the frame to prevent visibility issues during export. Furthermore, the updated design enhances user experience by offering a visually structured fare breakdown, making it easy for users to understand how their fare is calculated. The deliverables also ensure consistency in font style, spacing, and text formatting, aligning with the design principles of a professional ride-booking interface. The exported design has been reviewed to ensure that all images and text elements are properly included within the frame to prevent issues during final implementation. The final exported deliverables include high-resolution images of both designed screens, with properly structured alignment and refined typography.
